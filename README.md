# Awesome Object Storage Infrastructure

An opinionated list of awesome projects, frameworks, databases, and resources built atop object storage systems. Whether itâ€™s about implementing modern data platforms, logs, event-driven architectures, or large-scale analytics, these projects harness object-based backends to power scalable and resilient infrastructures.

## Conference Talks/Presentations
_A selection of tutorials, articles, talks, or other resources on using and scaling object-powered infrastructure._

[Object Storage is All You Need | (Justin Cormack, Docker)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0wwTy6_G4) - (This talk is a great entrypoint!) In this talk we look at why object storage is becoming so popular, the benefits, downsides and performance characteristics, and how and when to use it effectively.


## Event Streaming
_Solutions and frameworks that leverage object storage for large-scale data lake implementations, analytics processing, and more._

[Warpstream](https://docs.warpstream.com/) - High-performance streaming analytics engine built atop object storage.

[Responsive](https://www.responsive.dev/) - Responsive is an object storage based Kafka Streams implementation.

## Databases
_Databases, key-value stores, or specialized tooling that rely on object storage as their persistent data layer._

[SlateDB](https://slatedb.io/) - Rust based embedded database built on object storage. RocksDB alternative.
