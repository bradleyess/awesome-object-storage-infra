# Awesome Object Storage Infrastructure

An opinionated list of awesome projects, frameworks, databases, and resources built atop object storage systems. Whether itâ€™s about implementing modern data platforms, logs, event-driven architectures, or large-scale analytics, these projects harness object-based backends to power scalable and resilient infrastructures.

## Conference Talks/Presentations
_A selection of tutorials, articles, talks, or other resources on using and scaling object-powered infrastructure._

* [Object Storage is All You Need | (Justin Cormack, Docker)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0wwTy6_G4) - (This talk is a great entrypoint!) In this talk we look at why object storage is becoming so popular, the benefits, downsides and performance characteristics, and how and when to use it effectively.


## Event Streaming
_Solutions and frameworks that leverage object storage for large-scale data lake implementations, analytics processing, and more._

* [Warpstream](https://docs.warpstream.com/) - Kafka compatible event streaming engine built atop object storage.
* [Responsive](https://www.responsive.dev/) - Responsive is an object storage based Kafka Streams implementation.
* [S2](https://s2.dev/) - Serverless API for streaming data backed by object storage.

## Databases
_Databases, key-value stores, or specialized tooling that rely on object storage as their persistent data layer._

* [SlateDB](https://slatedb.io/) - SlateDB is an embedded storage engine built as a log-structured merge-tree. Unlike traditional LSM-tree storage engines, SlateDB writes all data to object storage.
